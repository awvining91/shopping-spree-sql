## challenge

The biggest challenge was that I was catching up on old homework assignments and didn't have much time to work on this assignment. And then project two started and I was very busy. Finally two out of four group members didn't contribute anything on our project 2 furthur adding more time constraints.

## next steps

I want to come back to this assignment when I have more time and complete it fully so I can add it to my portfolio.
